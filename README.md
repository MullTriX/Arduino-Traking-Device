# Arduino-Traking-Device
Tracking device for university project based on Arduino Pro mini 3.3V, SIM800L, Air530 and ADXL345.

The main goal of this project was to prototype a GPS tracking device which enables the user to get location of a given object. The ideal intervals between sended are supposed to be every 5km or 6h if the device is in rest.
Used modules: Acceleration Sensor ADXL345, Air530 (Rx= 4, Tx = 3), SIM800L (Rx = 8, Tx = 9), Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V
